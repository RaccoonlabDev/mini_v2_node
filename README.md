# Mini v2 node application examples

This repository contains an example of a simple Cyphal/DroneCAN applications written for the [Mini v2](https://docs.raccoonlab.co/guide/can_pwm/can_pwm_mini_v2.html#pinout) node. It allows you to easily get started with a custom Cyphal/DroneCAN application.

- [Libs/Cyphal](Libs/Cyphal) is based on the libcanard demo application. It has transport layer (CAN based on platform_specific_components), heap (based on o1heap) and ROM (based on libparams) implementations. It also has a helper script that transpiles source code from DSDL.
- [mini_v2](mini_v2) is a project generated with the STM32CubeMX. It is based on .ioc file corresponded to the default firmware of the Mini v2 node. You may only need to change it if you want to use an a different peripheral configuration.
- [Src/cyphal_application](Src/cyphal_application) is the main code for the application. You will need to modify it for your custom application. For now, the sample application just blinks the LED and behaves like a Cyphal node with few registers.

The process of compiling the software is described in [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt). However, it is expected to work with the project (build, generate dsdl, upload firmware) using the make command (see the usage example for details).

## 1. Prerequisites

You are expected to use the following software:
- (optional) [STM32CubeMX](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html) or [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html),
- Repository with minimal Cyphal application implementation based on [libcanard](https://github.com/OpenCyphal/libcanard), [o1heap](https://github.com/pavel-kirienko/o1heap) and other libraries,
- [Yukon](https://github.com/OpenCyphal-Garage/yukon).

Hardware requirements:
- Mini v2 node
- stm32 sniffer and programmer (for example [RL sniffer and programmer](https://docs.raccoonlab.co/guide/programmer_sniffer/))


## 2. Brief hardware description

Refer to the [Mini v2 hardware](https://docs.raccoonlab.co/guide/can_pwm/can_pwm_mini_v2.html#pinout) page for the details.

## 3. STM32CubeMX

In this example, the project has the following pinout configuration that is similar to what we have for the original CAN-PWM firmware.

## 4. Usage

You are expected to use Makefile to work with the project.

**Step 1. Clone the repository with submodules**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RaccoonlabDev/mini_v2_node --recursive
cd mini_v2_node
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

**Step 2. Connect Sniffer and programmer to Mini v2 node.**

For details of the connection refer to:
- [the Programmer connection](https://docs.raccoonlab.co/guide/programmer_sniffer/programmer.html) page,
- [the Sniffer connection](https://docs.raccoonlab.co/guide/programmer_sniffer/sniffer.html#_4-1-cyphal-usage) page.

**Step 3. Build the project and upload the firmware**

```bash
make generage_dsdl
make cyphal
make upload
```

**Step 4. Setup the environment and run Yukon**

```bash
source scripts/init.sh
~/Download/Yukon
```
