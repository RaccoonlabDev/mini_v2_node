The node has the following registers:

| â„–  | Register name           | Description |
| -- | ----------------------- | ----------- |
|  1 | uavcan.node.id          | Defines a node-ID. Allowed values [0,127]. |
|  2 | system.can_terminator   | Bitmask which switch can terminators (0 - both off, 1 - enables second, 2 - enables first, 3 - enables both). Works only for v3. |
|  3 | system.name             | Defines custom node name. If empty, the node will use the default name. |
|  4 | system.protocol         | Auto, Cyphal/CAN or DroneCAN |
|  5 | uavcan.node.description | User/integrator-defined, human-readable description of this specific node. |
|  6 | system.log_level        | Log level. See [debug.LogLevel](https://dronecan.github.io/Specification/7._List_of_standard_data_types/#loglevel) and [diagnostic.Severity](https://github.com/OpenCyphal/public_regulated_data_types/blob/master/uavcan/diagnostic/Severity.1.0.dsdl). </br> 0 - Log everything (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) </br> 1 - Log at least INFO level </br> 2 - Log at least WARNING level </br> 3 - Log at least ERROR level </br> 4 - Disable logging </br> By default 3 to show only realy important messages. |
|  7 | stats.engaged_time      | Total engaged time of node in seconds. |
|  8 | crct.bitmask            | Bit mask to enable CircuitStatus features: </br> Bit 1 - enable dev.Temperature with device_id=NODE_ID, </br> Bit 2 - enable 5v publisher, </br> Bit 3 - enable Vin publisher. </br> Bit 4 - enable overvoltage, undervoltage, overcurrent and overheat checks. </br> By default 15 that mean enable all publishers |
|  9 | feedback.type           | Indicates the operational mode of the node. 0 means disabled. When set to 1, the command of corresponding Status type for cmd_type will be transmitted (esc.RawCommand - esc.Status, actuator.ArrayCommand - actuator.Status) with frequency 1 Hz. When set to 2 - 10 Hz. |
|  10 | pwm.cmd_ttl_ms          | TTL of specified by pwm.cmd_type commands [ms]. |
|  11 | pwm.frequency           | PWM frequency [Hz]. |
|  12 | pwm1.ch                 | Index of setpoint channel. [-1; 255]. -1 means disabled, |
|  13 | pwm1.min                | PWM duration when setpoint is min (RawCommand is 0 or Command is -1.0) |
|  14 | pwm1.max                | PWM duration when setpoint is max (RawCommand is 8191 or Command is 1.0) |
|  15 | pwm1.def                | PWM duration when setpoint is negative or there is no setpoint at all. |
|  16 | pwm2.ch                 | Index of setpoint channel. [-1; 255]. -1 means disabled, |
|  17 | pwm2.min                | PWM duration when setpoint is min (RawCommand is 0 or Command is -1.0) |
|  18 | pwm2.max                | PWM duration when setpoint is max (RawCommand is 8191 or Command is 1.0) |
|  19 | pwm2.def                | PWM duration when setpoint is negative or there is no setpoint at all. |
|  20 | pwm3.ch                 | Index of setpoint channel. [-1; 255]. -1 means disabled, |
|  21 | pwm3.min                | PWM duration when setpoint is min (RawCommand is 0 or Command is -1.0) |
|  22 | pwm3.max                | PWM duration when setpoint is max (RawCommand is 8191 or Command is 1.0) |
|  23 | pwm3.def                | PWM duration when setpoint is negative or there is no setpoint at all. |
|  24 | pwm4.ch                 | Index of setpoint channel. [-1; 255]. -1 means disabled, |
|  25 | pwm4.min                | PWM duration when setpoint is min (RawCommand is 0 or Command is -1.0) |
|  26 | pwm4.max                | PWM duration when setpoint is max (RawCommand is 8191 or Command is 1.0) |
|  27 | pwm4.def                | PWM duration when setpoint is negative or there is no setpoint at all. |
|  28 | pwm.cmd_type            | 0 means RawCommand, 1 means ArrayCommand, 2 is reserved for hardpoint.Command. |
